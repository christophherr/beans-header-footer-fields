# Beans Header Footer Fields Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/christophherr/beans-header-footer-fields.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/christophherr/beans-header-footer-fields)

This WordPress plugin for the Beans Framekwork creates custom fields to output scripts and styles in the header and footer of a website.

Requires the Beans Framework and PHP 5.6+.

The functionality is inspired by the Genesis Framework, the implementation is 100% Beans.

## Usage

Easily add scripts and styles (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc...) for the whole website on the Beans Settings page and in the Customizer.

Scripts and styles specific to a single post or page (Conversion tracking, chat bots, etc...) can be added right in the editor screen of that post or page.

## Additional Disclaimer

Due to the nature of the plugin, the input is **NOT** sanitized or escaped and only users with `unfiltered_html` capability are able to see/use the fields.
